 Small library management app using SQLite, ListView, and multiple screens.

Create an SQLite database with a books table containing:
id (INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT)
title (TEXT)
author (TEXT)
genre (TEXT)
year (INTEGER)
Use two screens:
Screen 1: Displays all books in a ListView.
Screen 2: Form to add or edit book details.

Implement CRUD operations to manage the books.

Update the ListView whenever a book is added or edited.
